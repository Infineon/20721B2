Software Tools
--------------
The following applications are installed with ModusToolbox on your computer.

BT Spy:
    BTSpy is a trace viewer utility that can be used with WICED BT platforms to
    view protocol and application trace messages from the embedded device. The
    utility is located in the folder below. For more information, see readme.txt
    in the same folder.
    This utility can be run directly from the filesystem, or it can be run from
    the Tools section of the ModusToolbox IDE QuickPanel, or by right-clicking
    a project in the IDE Project Explorer pane and selecting the ModusToolbox
    context menu.
    It is supported on Windows, Linux and macOS.

BT/BLE Profile Client Control:
    This application emulates host MCU applications for BLE and BR/EDR profiles.
    It demonstrates WICED BT APIs. The application communicates with embedded
    apps over the WICED HCI interface. The application is located in the folder
    below. For more information, see readme.txt in the same folder.
    This utility can be run directly from the filesystem, or it can be run from
    the Tools section of the ModusToolbox IDE QuickPanel, or by right-clicking
    a project in the IDE Project Explorer pane and selecting the ModusToolbox
    context menu.
    It is supported on Windows, Linux and macOS.
    <Workspace Dir>\wiced_btsdk\tools\btsdk-host-apps-bt-ble\client_control

BLE Mesh Client Control:
    Similar to the above app, this application emulates host MCU applications
    for BLE Mesh models. It can configure and provision mesh devices and create
    mesh networks. The application is located in the folder below. For more
    information, see readme.txt in the same folder.
    This utility can be run directly from the filesystem, or it can be run from
    the Tools section of the ModusToolbox IDE QuickPanel (if a mesh-capable
    project is selected in the IDE Project Explorer pane), or by right-clicking
    a mesh-capable project in the IDE Project Explorer pane and selecting the
    ModusToolbox context menu.
    The full version is provided for Windows (VS_ClientControl) supporting all
    Mesh models.
    A limited version supporting only the Lighting model (QT_ClientControl) is
    provided for Windows, Linux, and macOS.

Peer apps:
    Applications that run on Windows, iOS or Android and act as peer BT apps to
    demonstrate specific profiles or features, communicating with embedded apps
    over the air.
    BLE apps location:
    <Workspace Dir>\wiced_btsdk\tools\btsdk-peer-apps-ble
    BLE Mesh apps location:
    <Workspace Dir>\wiced_btsdk\tools\btsdk-host-peer-apps-mesh\peer
    OTA apps location:
    <Workspace Dir>\wiced_btsdk\tools\btsdk-peer-apps-ota

Device Configurator:
    Use this tool to create a custom pin mapping for your device. Run this tool
    from the Tools section of the ModusToolbox IDE QuickPanel, or by
    right-clicking a project in the IDE Project Explorer pane and selecting the
    ModusToolbox context menu.
    It is supported on Windows, Linux and macOS.
    Note: The pin mapping is based on wiced_platform.h for your board.
    Location:
    <Install Dir>\tools_2.0\device-configurator

Bluetooth Configurator:
    Use this tool to create and configure the BLE GATT Database for your
    application.
    Run this tool from the Tools section of the ModusToolbox IDE QuickPanel, or
    by right-clicking a project in the IDE Project Explorer pane and selecting
    the ModusToolbox context menu.
    It is supported on Windows, Linux and macOS.
    Location:
    <Install Dir>\tools_2.0\bt-configurator

Tracing
-------
To view application traces, there are 2 methods available. Note that the
application needs to configure the tracing options.
1. WICED Peripheral UART - Open this port on your computer using a serial port
utility such as Tera Term or PuTTY (usually using 115200 baud rate).
2. WICED HCI UART - Open this port on your computer using the Client Control
application mentioned above (usually using 3M baud rate). Then run the BT Spy
utility mentioned above.

Application Settings
--------------------
Application settings can be changed in the application makefile. Options listed
below are available for all applications. Other application specific options may
also be available and are documented in the readme.txt for those applications.

BT_DEVICE_ADDRESS
    Set BT device address for your BT device. The BT address is 6 bytes,
    for example 20721B20FFEE. By default, the SDK will set a BDA for your device
    by combining the 7 hex digit device ID with the last 5 hex digits of the
    host PC MAC address.
UART
    Configure the UART port you want the application to be downloaded. For
    example 'COM6' on Windows or '/dev/ttyWICED_HCI_UART0' on Linux or
    '/dev/tty.usbserial-000154' on macOS.
    By default, the SDK will auto detect the port.
ENABLE_DEBUG
    For HW debugging, see the document WICED-Hardware-Debugging.pdf for more
    information. Configuring this setting with value =1 configures GPIO for SWD.
    CYW920721B2EVK-02: SWD hardware debugging supported. SWD signals are shared
    with D4 and D5, see SW9 in schematics.
    CYW920721B2EVK-03, CYW920721M2EVK-01: SWD hardware debugging is not supported.
    CYW920721M2EVK-02: SWD hardware debugging supported. SWDIO is on P03 and
    SWDCLK is on P05.

Downloading application to kit
------------------------------
If you have issues downloading to the kit, follow the steps below:
- Press and hold the 'Recover' button on the kit.
- Press and hold the 'Reset' button on the kit.
- Release the 'Reset' button.
- After one second, release the 'Recover' button.

Over The Air (OTA) Firmware Upgrade
-----------------------------------
Applications that support OTA upgrade can be updated via the peer OTA app in:
<Workspace Dir>\wiced_btsdk\tools\btsdk-peer-apps-ota
See the readme.txt file located in the above folder for instructions.
To generate OTA image for the app, configure OTA_FW_UPGRADE=1 in the app
makefile, or append OTA_FW_UPGRADE=1 to a build command line, for example:
> make PLATFORM=CYW920721B2EVK-02 OTA_FW_UPGRADE=1 build
This will generate <app>.bin file in the 'build' folder.
