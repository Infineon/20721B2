 *
 * Bluetooth SCO Hook Application Programming Interface
 *
 * The SCO Hook library provides API to access SCO/eSCO data (both received and sent).
 * This API can be used by the application to introduce a sound in the SCO data (to the Speaker
 * or from the Microphone) or to implement Noise Reduction and Echo Cancellation.
 * Incoming voice packets (i.e. from Audio Gateway) are passed to the application which can
 * modify them before they goes out of the chip (e.g. to external Codec for rendering).
 * Outgoing voice packets (e.g. from Microphone connected to an external Codec) are passed to the
 * application which can modify them before they are send (to the Audio Gateway).
 * The Audio Algorithm (DSP code) must be provided by the application.
 * Note that the CPU clock is increased to the maximum (i.e. 96 MHz) when the callback is called.
 * Once the callback returns, the CPU clock is set back to the normal frequency.
