/**  \addtogroup SerialFlashInterfaceDriver Serial Flash Interface
* \ingroup HardwareDrivers
* Defines a driver for the Serial Flash interface. The driver is responsible
* for interfacing with a Serial Flash memory module via the second SPI bus,
* with its main purpose being data handling operations. For instance, any
* unused space (from the system partition) can be used for any purpose to
* store and access data. It is a handy way for an app to save information to
* non-volatile storage.
*
*
* The software driver supports SPI Flashes with the following parameters:
* 1. Address Width - 24 bit addressing
* 2. Data Rate is specific to the IoT chip:
*       CYW207x9 supports SPI data rate upto 24MHz
* 3. Supports JEDEC's CFI (Common Flash Interface) compatible SPI Flash chips from
*    Cypress Semiconductors, SST, STMicroelectronics, Atmel, MXIC, Adesto, Winbond.
*
* Similar to the I2C EEPROM Interface Driver, this driver includes checks to
* ensure safe data handling operation--it will not allow any write or erase
* operations to take place within active sections (i.e., sections that the
* system currently uses for boot, etc). Note that read operations are
* unrestricted. Please reference the Kit Guide or HW User Manual for your device
* for more information regarding these active sections, their importance, and
* what roles they play in the system.
