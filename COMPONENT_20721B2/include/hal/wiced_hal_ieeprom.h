/**  \addtogroup I2CEEPROMInterfaceDriver I2C EEPROM Interface
* \ingroup I2CDriver
* @{
*
* Defines a driver for the I2C EEPROM interface. The driver is responsible for
* interfacing with an EEPROM module via the I2C bus, with its main purpose
* being data handling operations. For instance, any unused space (from the
* system partition) can be used for any purpose to store and access data. It
* is a handy way for an app to save information to non-volatile storage.
*
* Similar to the Serial Flash Interface Driver, this driver includes checks to
* ensure safe data handling operation--it will not allow any write operations
* to take place within active sections (i.e., sections that the system
* currently uses for boot, etc). Note that read operations are unrestricted.
* Please reference the Kit Guide or HW User Manual for your device for more
* information regarding these active sections, their importance, and what roles
* they play in the system.
