/** @file

 * @defgroup Transport     WICED Transport
 * @ingroup HardwareDrivers
 *
 * Defines the transport utilities for configuring the transport, send data and
 * receive data. This supports UART transport in HCI Mode
 *
 * Wiced Transport uses the generic pool available for receiving and sending packet
 * over the transport. Following are the configurations of the generic pool
 * 1:   buffer size - 8 bytes, buffer count - 128
 * 2:   buffer size - 32 bytes, buffer count - 48
 * 3:   buffer size - 96 bytes, buffer count - 50
 * 4:   buffer size - 268 bytes, buffer count - 12
 *
 * Using above generic pools the max payload size supportable is 252.(16 bytes for internal headers)
 * If the application wants to send packet of size more than the max size of the buffer
 * available in the generic pool, application can do so by creating a transport buffer
 * pool of the desired size. (Refer APIs wiced_transport_create_buffer_pool,
 * wiced_transport_allocate_buffer,wiced_transport_send_buffer)
 *
 *If the application wants to recieve packet of size more than the max size of the buffer
 * available in the generic pool, application can do so by configuring a receive buffer pool
 * of the desired size when doing transport init.
