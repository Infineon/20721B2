# BTSDK - CYW20721

## Overview

The Infineon CYW20721 is an ultra-low-power dual-mode Bluetooth 5.1 wireless MCU device. It has a stand-alone baseband processor with an integrated 2.4 GHz transceiver supporting LE/BR/EDR.

## SDK Software Features
- Dual mode Bluetooth stack included in the ROM (BR/EDR and LE).
- BT stack and profile level APIs for embedded BT application development.
- WICED HCI protocol to simplify host/MCU application development.
- APIs and drivers to access on board peripherals.
- Bluetooth protocols include GAP, GATT, SMP, RFCOMM, SDP, AVDT/AVCT, LE Mesh
- LE and BR/EDR profile APIs, libraries, and sample apps.
- Support for Over-The-Air (OTA) upgrade.
- Device Configurator for creating custom pin mapping.
- Bluetooth Configurator for creating LE GATT Database.
- Documentation for APIs, datasheet, profiles, and features.
